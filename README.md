The goal of this project create a drawing grid/canvas and functionalities around it. Have a try!

## Skills to practice

This is one of my first project, still getting familiar with HTML, CSS and JS. Achieving clean code takes time, and learning other completly new skills at te same time is not easy, my focus here was on : 
- DOM manipulations in JS
- Getting more familiar with CSS
- Working with Flexbox
- Working with Developer Tools

## Features

Draw on an online canvas, the options are the following :
- Rainbow (random) mode
- Gradient mode
- Eraser mode
- Pick canvas's color and drawing color
- Toggle visible / invisible borders on the grid
- Change resolution of the grid

## Improvements

- Reorganize / clean the code (regroup related functionnalities into classes/objects, break functions into even smaller and pure functions if possible ...)
- Separate DOM manipulations / UI interactions from logic
- Add interacive features to the UI to make it more dynamic
- Add a possibilty to store the current project (maybe through local storage)
